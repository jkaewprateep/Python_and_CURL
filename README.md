    <b> Communication using CURL command for RESFUL services protocol negotiation and transmission </b> </br>
    <b> ( Picture from Internet ) </b> </br>
</p>
</br>
</br>

üß∏üí¨ We selected to use the CURL command because it is a standard application for communication HTTP, readable messages, and RESTFUL web service protocol as it passed security policy for wide area networks and communication application best practices in many customers and application development recommendations. </br>
üêëüí¨ ‚û∞ For saved time and complex test scenarios select a known method for communication when application development of both existing and future protocol support will make your life easier because of the gift from the explorer but not make it a landmine because they are shared resources and widely know, many people will start trying to cheat it as there are more oppotunity. </br>
üêêüí¨ Readble message communication by default they will extract information they are required and leave what they do not know but forward if they are ignored restriction headers fields in the communications. Once we had performed billing items counter, customer information transmission, ```UUID transfer for references external records``` from the system but there is a chance information can leak from communication messages oneway is by HTTP protocols when applications designed to work with the known system and sometimes they communication reference level you do not need to intercepts the message but by ```broadcasting duplicated``` (a technique called broadcasting duplicated ) the terminal that exists or not exists may receive search information message or required information request as they are priority action for some system. </br>

üêØüí¨ Culture-INFO, ```BASIC authen``` used to be a standard secured communication negotiation method now without ```salts message``` they tread as a non-encrypted message. Communication with CTI and IT network devices requires only basic authentication when you can compose them and use basic SHA or target security algorithms to create encryption messages without the requirement of a high-speed computer. Later they need to have indices numbers or slat messages to make them more secure even if they are fast communication inside the organization. I had to challenge this oppotunity and say my opinion the message does not change to make the appliation change their behaviors and they perform the same actions as they required in the development application scenarios when multiple applications in solution are working with none-secured messages and readable when you use networks traffic monitoring program ( as sample Oracle shifted 4 bytes and the tool known about it ) </br>

    <b> Subprocess execution and JSON data loading </b> </br>
</p>
</br>
</br>

ü¶Åüí¨ Sub-process and ```shlex``` are used when shlex is used for decorating the CURL command parameters and decorator applications are the applications in the solution that should provide the same information inputs and outputs by modifying the formats with a priority of the message or composed with information table can display, trackable and reversible at least to convert transaction format from their source or different source to the action of users and program. The sub-process is the Python resource manager to executes commands from Python code, this method is controllable and limited number of processes and protection against duplicated port listening because of software application behavior to prevent blocked communication messages ( there is a technique that force applications to search or find of new port communication for priority message called ```duplicated listeners``` ) </br>
